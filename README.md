<h1>Contract Automata Tool (Lib) </h1>

The Contract Automata Tool is an ongoing basic research activity about implementing 
and experimenting with new developments in the theoretical framework of contract automata.
Contract automata are a formalism developed in the research area of foundations for services and distributed 
computing.
They are used for specifying services' interface, called behavioral contracts, 
 as finite-state automata, with functionalities for composing contracts and generating the 
 orchestration or choreography of a composition of services, and with extensions to modalities (MSCA) and product 
 lines (FMCA).

The source code has been redesigned and refactored  in Java 8.

<h2>Usage</h2>

The  package  of the GUI Application, previously in this 
repository, has been moved to https://github.com/davidebasile/ContractAutomataApp.
Check that repository for an example of usage of the API of the Contract Automata Tool, contained 
in this project.

<h2>License</h2>
The tool is available under Creative Common License 4.0,
 https://github.com/davidebasile/ContractAutomataLib/blob/code-cleaning/license.html.


<h2>Tutorials</h2>

A first video tutorial is available at https://youtu.be/LAzCEQtYOhU and it shows the usage of the tool for composing automata and compute orchestrations of product lines, using the examples published in JSCP2020.
The directory demoJSCP contains an executable jar and the models used in this tutorial.

The second video tutorial, available at https://youtu.be/W0BHlgQEhIk, shows the computation of orchestrations and choreographies for the examples published in LMCS2020.
The directory demoLMCS2020 contains an executable jar and the models used in this tutorial.

The third video tutorial, available at https://youtu.be/QJjT7f7vlZ4, shows the recent refactoring and improvements of the tool published in Coordination2021.

<h2>Package Structure</h2>

The structure of the Contract Automata Tool is composed of two  packages:

**contractAutomata** This package (depicted below) is the core of the tool. 
The core is the class `MSCA.java` implementing the algorithm
for synthesising a safe orchestration, choreography, or most permissive controller.
This class offers functionalities for composing automata, for computing the union
of `MSCA` and other utilities.

[fig:the class diagram of contractAutomata package]

The Java classes `BasicDataConverter.java` and `BasicMxeConverter.java`, implementing 
the corresponding interfaces,   are used for the storing of file descriptors.
There are two types of formats: 
An automaton is stored in either a readable textual representation
(`*.data`) or an XML format (`*.mxe)`. The `*.data` format can be 
used by any textual editor and it consists of a textual
declaration of states and transitions of each automaton. The XML
representation of a contract (`*.mxe`) is used by the GUI for saving and
loading CA. This file descriptor also stores information related to
the graphical visualization of the CA.  
A JsonConverter is also under construction.


**family** 
This package contains the classes `Family.java` containing a set of products  `Product.java` composing a given product line.  
`Family.java` is equipped with methods for storing and loading a `*.prod`  textual description of a product line, as well as for importing 
an `.xml` model of a feature model designed in FeatureIDE, whose products have already been generated by FeatureIDE. 
When importing from FeatureIDE, the sub-families are also generated, called partial products.
`Family.java` organises the products into a partial order (variable po), and there are methods for accessing adjacent products 
of a product in the partial ordering relation.
Each object of  `Product.java` contains two sets of features (required and forbidden) described in `Feature.java`.
The class `FMCA.java` contains an MSCA object and its corresponding Family. 
`FMCA.java`  contains the methods for computing the products respecting validity of a family (see references JSCP2020), 
for computing the canonical products, for computing the orchestration of either a product or the service product line, either exploiting the partial order 
or with an enumerative approach. 
The wiki contains an excerpt from a published paper regarding the product lines functionalities of the tool.
