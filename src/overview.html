    The Contract Automata Library supports the Contract Automata formalism and their operations, and can be easily extended to support similar automata-based formalisms.
    <br>
    Currently, synchronous Communicating Machines are also supported by the library. <br>
    This library is a by-product of scientific research on behavioural types/contracts, and implements results published in international conferences and journals. <br>
    Using the library it is possible to create new automata, import/export them, and to perform operations
    on them, as for example computing a composition of contracts, or computing a refinement of a composition satisfying
    some property (expressed as an automaton or an invariant). <br>
</p>

<p>
    Contract automata are a dialect of Finite State Automata, with special labels and tailored composition and synthesis
    operations.  <br>
    Contract automata are composable: a composition of contracts is again a contract automaton. <br>
    Contract automata support as operation the synthesis of the most permissive controller from Supervisory
    Control Theory for Discrete Event Systems. <br>
    Contract automata are used to express behavioural contracts, which are used to specify (behavioural)
    services interfaces, for computing a composition of contracts and synthesise a composition enjoying well-behaving properties,
    specified as invariants or as automata.
</p>

<p>
    Contract automata formalise behavioural service contracts in terms of service offer actions
    and service request actions that need to match to achieve agreement among a composition of contracts. <br>
    Modalities are used to indicate when an action must be matched (necessary) and when it can be withdrawn (permitted)
    in the synthesised coordination. <br>
    Contract automata can be configured using a product line, where each product (or configuration) predicate on which actions are required
    and which are forbidden.
